# Chrome Extension Testing Report

## Test Suite Overview

WaniKanify uses Playwright extension tests with the official Chrome extension testing approach:

### Chrome Extension Integration Tests  
- **Files**: `tests/e2e/extension.spec.ts` + `tests/e2e/fixtures.ts`
- **Purpose**: Tests complete extension functionality using official Playwright extension testing methodology
- **Coverage**: Chromium only (Playwright extension testing limitation)

## Test Results

| Test Suite | Result | Command |
|------------|--------|---------|
| **Chrome Extension Integration** | ✅ Pass (5/5 tests) | `npx playwright test extension --project=chromium` |

## Browser Compatibility Notes

- **Chromium/Chrome**: Full extension testing via Playwright ✅
- **Firefox/Edge/Safari**: Playwright does not support extension loading for these browsers ⚠️
- **Cross-Browser Testing**: Manual testing required for non-Chromium browsers

## Extension Test Details

The Chrome extension tests (`extension.spec.ts`) use the [official Playwright Chrome extension testing approach](https://playwright.dev/docs/chrome-extensions) with proper fixtures (`fixtures.ts`) and validate:

1. ✅ **Extension Loading**: Service worker availability and extension ID detection
2. ✅ **Popup Functionality**: Extension popup page loads correctly  
3. ✅ **Options Page**: Configuration interface with form elements (4 textareas, 22 inputs, 23 buttons)
4. ✅ **Content Processing**: Extension processes web page content (with proper false-positive prevention)
5. ✅ **Storage Configuration**: Extension vocabulary configuration works

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all Chrome extension tests (only available test suite)
npx playwright test extension --project=chromium

# Install Playwright browsers (one-time setup)
npx playwright install
```

## Manual Testing for Other Browsers

For Firefox, Edge, and Safari compatibility validation:
1. Build the extension: `npm run build:all` (recommended) or `npm run build` for a single Chrome-target build
2. Load the appropriate unpacked folder:
	- Chrome/Edge: `build/chrome-mv3-prod/`
	- Firefox: `build/firefox-mv3-prod/`
3. (Optional) Use the packaged zips (`chrome-mv3-prod.zip`, `firefox-mv3-prod.zip`) for store submission tests
4. Test core functionality: options page, popup, content processing on various websites
