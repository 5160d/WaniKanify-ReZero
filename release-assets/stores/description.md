Practice Japanese everywhere: WaniKanify ReZero swaps English text for the WaniKani vocabulary you have unlocked, with SRS filters, custom lists, audio, and site controls.

## Learn Japanese as you browse
WaniKanify ReZero swaps everyday English words on websites with the Japanese you’ve learned on WaniKani—so you keep practicing naturally while doing what you already do online.

Connect your WaniKani account, pick which levels to include, and let the extension highlight and replace words on the page. Helpful readings, optional audio, and simple controls make it easy to learn at your pace.

### What you’ll get
- Use your WaniKani vocabulary: sign in with a personal access token and choose which SRS levels to show.
- Clear, friendly replacements: see the Japanese terms in context, with readings on hover.
- Audio, your way: click or hover to hear pronunciations when available (with a fallback when needed).
- Make it yours: add custom vocab, import from a Google Sheet, or hide words you don’t want replaced.
- Works where you are: allow or block sites, and toggle on/off per page from the toolbar.

### Getting started
1) Install WaniKanify ReZero
2) Open the options page and paste your WaniKani API token (read scope)
3) Choose your SRS levels and preferences
4) Refresh vocabulary and start browsing

### Privacy
Your token, settings, and vocabulary cache stay on your device. The extension only talks to the official WaniKani API using your token. Requested permissions: storage (for settings and cache) and activeTab (so you can toggle replacements on the current page).
